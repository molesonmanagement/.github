# Moleson Management

**Data Science & Automation Consulting for SMEs**

We help small and medium-sized businesses adopt data-driven tools and automation — without needing an in-house engineering team. Our approach is hands-on: we build the models, design the workflows, and deploy the infrastructure, then hand you something that works.

## What We Do

### Data Analytics & Predictive Modeling
Custom dashboards, forecasting models, and data pipelines tailored to your business. We work with tools like **Tableau**, **Power BI**, and purpose-built analytics — whatever fits the problem. Our background in financial modeling means we know how to make data actionable, not just visual.

### AI & Machine Learning
From classification and anomaly detection to neural networks and NLP — we integrate ML into existing business processes where it creates real value. No hype, no unnecessary complexity. We deploy models that run in production, not just notebooks.

### Automation
Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Business Process Automation (BPA), and custom scripting to eliminate manual workflows. We've helped clients reduce administrative workloads by over 60% through intelligent automation pipelines — email triage, invoice processing, report generation, and more.

### DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure
Cloud architecture on **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Azure**. CI/CD pipelines, containerized deployments, and infrastructure-as-code. We design systems that scale with your business and don't require a dedicated ops team to maintain.

### Web & Application Development
Full-stack development using modern frameworks (**React**, **Angular**) and native mobile (iOS, Android). UI/UX design grounded in design thinking and user research — we build interfaces that people actually want to use.

### Agentic AI & Workflow Automation
Custom AI assistants and multi-modal automation pipelines built on open-source tooling. Self-hosted or cloud-deployed. We integrate with your existing stack via **Slack**, **Discord**, or custom interfaces — using RAG pipelines, speech-to-text, OCR, and model orchestration (MCP).

## Our Approach

- **Domain expertise first.** We come from finance, energy, and portfolio management — we understand business problems before reaching for technical solutions.
- **Build to hand off.** Everything we deliver is documented, maintainable, and designed to outlast the engagement.
- **Right-sized solutions.** We match the tool to the problem. Sometimes that's a Python script; sometimes it's a Rust-based data engine. We don't oversell.
